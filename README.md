# Water_Level_Indicator
This project uses a simple but effective bipolar transistor to know the level of water. When the connection become close, the signal flow through the base of the transistor then transistor allows the current to flow from collector to emitter and make a buzzer and led to work as an indicator.
Component list: NPN Transistor, Buzzer, and LED.
Feature: Precision Water Level Indicator  Using with Indication Probe  9V battery Powering  double layer  Water level notify with powerful buzzer  prompt detection with LED
